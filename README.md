## 🛠️ Development Workflow

To keep `main` stable, **direct pushes to `main` are trying to be blocked**.  
All changes **must go through a Pull Request (PR)**.

### ✅ How to Make Changes

#### 1. Create a new branch
Always branch off `main`.

#### Demo change

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/short-description
